# statistical_learning_models_comparison
 This project is part of PH526x Harvard Course "Python for Research". This project is based on a database of 5000 movies catalogued by The Movie Database (TMDb). The information available about each movie is its budget, revenue, rating, actors and actresses, etc. This dataset was used to determine whether any information about a movie can predict the total revenue of a movie and classify if movie is goinf to be profitable or not. Then the comparison graph of two regression and classification models accuracy score was plotted.
